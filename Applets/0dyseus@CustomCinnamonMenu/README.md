## Custom Cinnamon Menu applet description

This applet is a custom version of the default Cinnamon Menu applet.

## Added options/features

- The separator between **Favorites** box and **Quit** box can have a custom height. I couldn't find a way to make this flexible or automatic.
- The search box can be moved to the bottom.
- The applications info box (that thing that is used instead of a good old tooltip ¬¬) can be hidden.
- The size of the Favorites/Categories/Applications icons can be customized.
- The ammount of recent files can be customized.
- The **Quit** buttons can be hidded all at once or individually.
- The **Recent Files** category can be hidden. This is for people who want the **Recent Files** category hidden without disabling recent files globally.
- Added Fuzzy search. Based on [Sane Menu](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/258s) applet.
