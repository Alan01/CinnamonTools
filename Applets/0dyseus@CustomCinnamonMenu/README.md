## Custom Cinnamon Menu applet description

This applet is a custom version of the default Cinnamon Menu applet.

## Compatibility

Tested and working on Cinnamon version 3.0.7.

## Added options/features

- The separator between **Favorites** box and **Quit** box can have a custom height. I couldn't find a way to make this flexible or automatic.
- The search box can be moved to the bottom.
- The applications info box (that thing that is used instead of a good old tooltip ¬¬) can be hidden.
- The size of the Favorites/Categories/Applications icons can be customized.
- The amount of recent files can be customized.
- The **Quit** buttons can be hidden all at once or individually.
- The **Recent Files** category can be hidden. This is for people who want the **Recent Files** category hidden without disabling recent files globally.
- Added Fuzzy search. Based on [Sane Menu](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/258s) applet by **nooulaif**.

<h2 style="color:red;"> Bug report and feature request</h2>
<span style="color:red;">
Spices comments system is absolutely useless to report bugs with any king of legibility. In addition, there is no notifications system for new comments. So, if anyone has bugs to report or a feature request, do so on this applet GitHub page. Just click the **Website** button next to the **Download** button.
