## System Monitor fork applet description

This applet is a fork of [System Monitor](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/88) applet by Josef Mich√°lek (Aka Orcus).

## Differences with the original
- I enabled the use of alpha to all the color pickers in the settings window.
- I added a notification in case the User doesn't have installed the gjs package to make this applet settings window to work.
