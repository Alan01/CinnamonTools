## Window list fork applet description

This applet is a fork of the default Window-list applet shipped with Cinnamon.

## Differences with the original
- Added option to remove the label from the window list buttons.
- Added icons to the window list button's context menu.

<h2 style="color:red;"> Bug report and feature request</h2>
<span style="color:red;">
Spices comments system is absolutely useless to report bugs with any king of legibility. In addition, there is no notifications system for new comments. So, if anyone has bugs to report or a feature request, do so on this applet GitHub page. Just click the **Website** button next to the **Download** button.
