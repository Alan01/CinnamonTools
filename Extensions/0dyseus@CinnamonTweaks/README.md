## Cinnamon Tweaks extension description

This extension adds some options to modify the default behaviour of certain Cinnamon features.

## Compatibility

Tested and working on Cinnamon versions 2.8.6 and 3.0.7 (stable and nightly).

**Important note:** Do not try to install and force compatibility for any other version of Cinnamon older than 2.8.6. As a protection mechanism, the extension will auto-disable itself.

## Features/Options

- Ask for confirmation on applet removal.

<h2 style="color:red;"> Bug report and feature request</h2>
<span style="color:red;">
Spices comments system is absolutely useless to report bugs with any king of legibility. In addition, there is no notifications system for new comments. So, if anyone has bugs to report or a feature request, do so on this applet GitHub page. Just click the **Website** button next to the **Download** button.
