## Mint-XY-Greybird-Blue theme description

This theme is basically the default **Mint-X** theme with some graphics (check/radio boxes, switch buttons, etc.) from the **Mint-Y** theme. It's called **Mint-XY-Greybird-Blue** because I changed all accent colors to the color blue used by the [Greybird theme](https://github.com/shimmerproject/Greybird).
