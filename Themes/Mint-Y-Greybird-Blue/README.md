## Mint-Y-Greybird-Blue theme description

This theme is based on the default **Mint-Y** theme but instead of using the green color, I used a blue color (the same blue used by the Greybird theme). .

## Abandoned
This theme is a total waste of time, as well as each and every one of the so called flat themes. The day that everybody stops spiting all over usability and common sense, I might consider again start wasting my time on one of these aberrations.
