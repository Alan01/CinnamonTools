## Cinnamon Maximus Fork extension description

This extension is a fork of the [Cinnamon Maximus](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/extensions/view/29) extension by Fatih Mete. The main difference with the original is that I removed the blacklist feature in favor of a whitelist feature. I also added a couple of options for troubleshooting and completely removed the top border of undecorated maximized windows.

## Compatibility

- ![Cinnamon 2.8](https://odyseus.github.io/CinnamonTools/lib/badges/cinn-2.8.svg) ![Linux Mint 17.3](https://odyseus.github.io/CinnamonTools/lib/badges/lm-17.3.svg)
- ![Cinnamon 3.0](https://odyseus.github.io/CinnamonTools/lib/badges/cinn-3.0.svg) ![Linux Mint 18](https://odyseus.github.io/CinnamonTools/lib/badges/lm-18.svg)
- ![Cinnamon 3.2](https://odyseus.github.io/CinnamonTools/lib/badges/cinn-3.2.svg) ![Linux Mint 18.1](https://odyseus.github.io/CinnamonTools/lib/badges/lm-18.1.svg)

## Features and options

- It removes the windows decorations of all maximized windows.
- If the option **Undecorate when tiled** is enabled, tiled windows will also have their decorations removed.
- If the option **Use Whitelist** is enabled, only the window decorations of the applications listed will be removed when maximized.

## Dependencies

- xprop
- xwininfo

**Note:** Both commands are already available on Linux Mint. They are installed by the **x11-utils** package.
