Multi Translator extension ToDo list:
 ☐ **Implement translation history** @critical
 ☐ **Implement a mechanism to check for dependencies** @critical
 ☐ **Change all synchronous functions to asynchronous** @high
 ☐ **Add Yandex API keys configuration** @high
 ☐ **Make Yandex API keys usage random** @high
 ☐ **Add more translation providers:** At least as much as translate-shell supports. @high
 ☐ **Add the possibility to select a custom theme** @high
 ☐ **Keep looking for a way to reload the themes without the need to restart Cinnamon** Keep in mind the comment block in extension.js>TranslatorExtension>_loadTheme(). @high
 ☐ **Create the dark Linux Mint theme** @low

Multi Translator applet (Not started yet) ToDo list:
  Clicking on applet:
    ☐ Can bring up the extension dialog.
    ☐ Can translate selection/clipboard and show result in a popup menu (Just like Popup Translator applet).
    ☐ Can translate selection/clipboard and show result in a notification.

  Ideas:
    ☐ Make the applet complement with the extension, but not depend on it.
    ☐ Make the translation mechanism shared between the extension and the applet.
      ☐ It will require to store the history file in a place that can be accessed by the extension and the applet.
      ☐ It will require to ship the extension and the applet with the exact same Python script.
    ☐ Add several translation mechanisms that doesn't depend on the extension, but just on the **trans** command.
    ☐ Create a couple of key bindings to trigger several types of translations.
    ☐ Add options to choose between a **brief** and a **detailed** translation result.
